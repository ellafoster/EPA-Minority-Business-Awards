# EPA-Minority-Business-Awards

## Description

**Who are your stakeholders?**
Our stakeholders are small women and minority-owned business owners or C-suite executives who are hoping to reduce the financial burden of environmental initiatives in their organization by applying for EPA grants. The American general public is also a stakeholder who will receive human health and environmental benefits from these businesses when they utilize the award grants to help the EPA achieve its mission. 

**What problem are you trying to solve for the stakeholders?**
The EPA award application process can be a long and confusing process and stakeholders want to know the amount they can budget for environmental initiatives, new technologies, and hiring new project staff.

**How will you solve the problem?**
We will build and deploy a classificiation prediction model using binary bayes for stakeholders to input characteristics of their business and receive an output that will estimate a potential EPA grant award amount to expect. The potential amount will either be less than $940,000 between 940,000 and 7 million or greater than $7 million.
